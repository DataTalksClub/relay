# Datamailer Design System

Datamailer is an operational email tool. The interface should be clean, easy to scan, and calm under production pressure.

We use our own lightweight CSS system. Do not add Bootstrap, Tailwind, React, a SPA framework, or a required frontend build pipeline unless a future issue explicitly changes this decision.

## References

Use these references for UI elements and interaction quality:

- DataOps design system (`../dataops/frontend/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`) and the
  Course Management Platform system it builds on: the primary visual
  reference. GitHub Primer neutrals, restrained borders, compact row-based
  content, content-width actions, and the CMP blue accent.
- GitHub Primer: primary reference for product UI foundations, compact navigation, subdued surfaces, tables, forms, labels, focus states, and status treatment.
- Shopify Polaris: secondary reference for admin workflow discipline, especially promoted filters vs advanced filters and clear page actions.
- Resend: secondary reference for API docs, API keys, developer-facing settings, sparse examples, and transactional email vocabulary.
- Dapier ("Operator's Ledger") is a sibling look, not the reference here; keep
  Datamailer aligned with DataOps.

Use Postmark only for product concepts, not visual styling:

- delivery activity
- bounces and complaints
- suppression handling
- message streams
- transactional vs broadcast email operations

## Principles

- Clean and easy first.
- Operational clarity over marketing polish.
- Dense but readable beats decorative and oversized.
- The first screen of a detail page must answer the core operational question.
- Primary state and primary action should be obvious.
- Raw provider payloads, audit metadata, and debugging details belong in secondary sections.
- UI labels and URLs should use user language, not implementation language.
- No backwards compatibility is required before production unless an issue explicitly says otherwise.

Core questions by page:

- Contact: can we email this person, and why or why not?
- Campaign: what was sent, to whom, and what happened?
- Audience: who is included, how are they segmented, and who is inactive?
- Client: which integration is this, which API keys are active, and what are they used for?
- Template: what context is required, and what will be rendered?
- API docs: how do I make the request, and what response should I expect?

## CSS Direction

Keep CSS small and explicit:

- design tokens in one place, under `:root`
- reusable layout primitives
- reusable form/table/badge/button/disclosure patterns
- page-specific CSS only when a reusable primitive is not enough

The default implementation should work with plain Django templates and static CSS.

Preferred file direction:

- `static/mailing/css/app.css` for the design system and product UI
- no large inline CSS in templates
- no generated CSS checked in unless a future build process is approved

Current shared primitive hooks:

- shell/navigation: `.app-header`, `.app-nav`, `.app-shell`, `.app-sidebar`, `.sidebar-nav`, `.sidebar-toggle`, `.app-main`, `aria-current="page"`
- layout: `.page-header`, `.section-header`, `.section`, `.detail-section`, `.breadcrumbs`, `.meta-grid`, `.stats-grid`, `.detail-grid`, `.compact-list`, `.compact-row`
- actions: `.button`, `.button.secondary`, `.button.danger`, `.actions`, `.action-row`, `.toolbar`
- forms/filters: `.form-grid`, `.form-field`, `.field-errors`, `.form-errors`, `.helptext`, `.filter-grid`, `.promoted-filter-grid`, `.filter-bar`, `.checkbox-list`, `.advanced-panel`
- operational data: `.table-wrap`, `.nowrap`, `.truncate`, `.pagination`, `.empty-state`
- state and feedback: `.badge`, `.badge.success`, `.badge.warning`, `.badge.danger`, `.badge.neutral`, `.messages`, `.message`, `.alert`
- activity/debug: `.timeline`, `.timeline-item`, `.audit-row`, `pre`, `code`

## Tokens

All reusable styling must flow through tokens before page-specific CSS is added. Add a token only when at least two components can use it or when it represents a system-level decision.

### Color Tokens

Core surface and text tokens (values follow the DataOps/Primer palette; the
light page canvas is white, the sidebar and secondary surfaces use `#f6f8fa`,
and the action/link accent is CMP blue `#315f8f`):

- `--dm-color-text`
- `--dm-color-heading`
- `--dm-color-muted`
- `--dm-color-faint`
- `--dm-color-border`
- `--dm-color-border-strong`
- `--dm-color-background`
- `--dm-color-surface`
- `--dm-color-surface-strong` (hover/active tone)
- `--dm-color-accent-soft` (selected navigation and focus wash)
- `--dm-color-focus`

Action tokens:

- `--dm-color-primary` (filled controls; dark mode uses a lighter fill)
- `--dm-color-primary-hover`
- `--dm-color-link` (links and selected-nav text; stays readable in dark mode)
- `--dm-color-link-hover`
- `--dm-color-on-primary`

State tokens:

- `--dm-color-success`
- `--dm-color-success-surface`
- `--dm-color-success-border`
- `--dm-color-warning`
- `--dm-color-warning-surface`
- `--dm-color-warning-border`
- `--dm-color-danger`
- `--dm-color-danger-hover`
- `--dm-color-danger-surface`
- `--dm-color-danger-border`
- `--dm-color-info`
- `--dm-color-info-surface`
- `--dm-color-info-border`
- `--dm-color-neutral`
- `--dm-color-neutral-surface`
- `--dm-color-neutral-border`

Do not use raw hex values outside `:root` unless there is a documented exception.

### Spacing Tokens

Use the spacing scale for layout and component gaps:

- `--dm-space-1`: 4px
- `--dm-space-2`: 8px
- `--dm-space-3`: 12px
- `--dm-space-4`: 16px
- `--dm-space-5`: 20px
- `--dm-space-6`: 24px
- `--dm-space-8`: 32px

Do not introduce one-off spacing values for page layout. If a repeated spacing need appears, add a token.

### Shape And Type Tokens

- `--dm-radius-sm`: controls, badges, nav items
- `--dm-radius-md`: panels, empty states, table wrappers
- `--dm-font-sans`: Inter (self-hosted, SIL OFL)
- `--dm-font-mono`: IBM Plex Mono (self-hosted, SIL OFL); quantities, timings, and IDs render as data, not prose
- `--dm-font-size-sm`: labels, help text, table headers
- `--dm-font-size-base`: body and form controls
- `--dm-font-size-lg`: section headings
- `--dm-font-size-xl`: page headings
- `--dm-control-height`: inputs and buttons
- `--dm-content-width`: readable main-column width
- `--dm-sidebar-width`: persistent sidebar width

Letter spacing stays normal. Font sizes do not scale with viewport width.
The shared component radius is 6px. Normal surfaces carry no shadow; shadows
are reserved for overlays.

## Component Contract

Use these primitives before creating page-specific classes.

### App Shell

- Top header contains global actions: brand, Clients, API Docs, Admin, active client switcher.
- Left sidebar contains active-client navigation: Dashboard, Campaigns, Audiences, Contacts, Templates, Client settings.
- Sidebar can be collapsed and must remain keyboard accessible.
- Do not repeat active client text inside every scoped page unless the user needs it to disambiguate a destructive action.

### Filters

- Use promoted filters for the 2-4 controls most users need first.
- Put secondary filters in `.advanced-panel`.
- Active filters appear as badges below the form.
- Avoid showing large checkbox groups by default.

### Tables

- Default list tables should fit 4-6 meaningful columns.
- Combine related status details into one cell using badges and muted secondary text.
- Move raw IDs, provider IDs, metadata, and error payloads into detail pages or disclosures.

### Details And Diagnostics

- Summary sections answer the operational question first.
- Diagnostics use `<details>` or a secondary section.
- Raw context, rendered HTML, SES IDs, metadata, and audit rows are diagnostics unless the page is explicitly a debugging page.

## Layout

- Use a stable app shell with clear navigation.
- Prefer compact top navigation or a restrained sidebar if navigation grows.
- Use active navigation states.
- Use breadcrumbs on detail pages when they improve orientation.
- Keep content widths readable, but allow operational tables to use wider space.
- Avoid nested cards.
- Use sections, tables, split layouts, and timelines instead of card grids.
- On mobile, prioritize core state and actions before large tables.

## Typography

- Use the self-hosted Inter stack (`--dm-font-sans`) for UI text and IBM Plex
  Mono (`--dm-font-mono`) for quantities, timings, IDs, and code. Fonts must
  not make third-party requests.
- Keep letter spacing normal.
- Do not scale font size with viewport width.
- Page titles are 32px semibold on desktop and 22px on mobile.
- Section headings are compact (16px semibold).
- Body and row text is 14px; table and metadata text may drop to 12-13px.
- Help text should be short and muted.

## Color

Use a restrained neutral base:

- strong text
- muted text
- border
- subtle background
- elevated surface only when needed

Use status colors consistently:

- success: verified, delivered, active, subscribed
- warning: pending, risky, skipped, needs attention
- danger: bounced, complained, failed, unsubscribed, revoked
- neutral: draft, unknown, inactive, none

Do not let pages become dominated by one hue or by decorative gradients.

## Components

### Buttons

- One primary action per page region.
- Secondary actions should be visually quieter.
- Destructive actions use danger styling and confirmation.
- Avoid button rows with many equally loud actions.

### Badges

Use badges for short state labels:

- verified / unverified
- valid / risky / invalid
- subscribed / unsubscribed
- active / revoked
- delivered / bounced / complained / failed

Badges should not wrap awkwardly inside tables.

### Tables

Tables are the default for operational lists.

- Keep columns predictable.
- Use truncation for long email, URL, metadata, and subject values.
- Avoid cramming too many columns into the first view.
- Move secondary data into detail pages or expandable rows.
- Preserve filters and pagination state.
- Empty states should say what is missing and what the next action is.

### Forms

- Every input has a visible label.
- Related fields are grouped.
- Validation errors appear next to the relevant field.
- Long text areas need context or preview when the user is composing something important.
- Mutation-heavy forms should not dominate read-only detail pages.

### Detail Pages

Use a summary-first structure:

1. Identity and state.
2. Sendability or operational eligibility.
3. Key metrics.
4. Membership/configuration.
5. Recent activity.
6. Audit/debug details.

If a page becomes long, split it into clear sections or tabs. Do not place every edit form at the top.

### API Docs

API docs should feel closer to Resend than to generated reference docs:

- examples before exhaustive reference
- copy-pasteable curl examples
- demo API keys from local seed data
- example request bodies
- example success responses
- common error responses
- links from examples to API key management

## URL And IA Rules

- Product UI routes should not use `/operator`.
- Client API routes should use `/api` before production.
- Contact UI URLs should use stored normalized email addresses instead of numeric IDs.
- Keep Django admin at `/admin/`.
- Route names, page titles, and navigation labels should use the same vocabulary.

## Accessibility

- Inputs must have labels.
- Links and buttons must be keyboard reachable.
- Focus states must be visible.
- Text must not overlap or overflow at mobile widths.
- Tables need accessible headers.
- Public unsubscribe pages must be simple, accessible, and trustworthy.

## Applying This Guide

All UI issues should reference this guide. When changing a page, check:

- Does the first screen answer the page's core question?
- Are actions ranked by importance?
- Are tables readable and not overloaded?
- Are statuses consistent with the shared badge language?
- Is the URL human-readable?
- Would the page still be usable during an incident or production email send?
